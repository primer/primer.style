# Contributing to Primer

There are several ways you can contribute to and participate in Primer:

- Participate in discussions
- Submit an issue
- Improve the documentation
- Close issues
- Propose a new component or UI pattern
- Questions and support

Please note that all contributions to Primer need to follow our code of conduct. You can find the code of conduct in the root folder of each [Primer repository](https://github.com/primer).

## Participate in discussions

Discussions about improvements and upcoming work happen mostly in issues and in the #design-system Slack channel (internal to GitHub users). 

These are the key repos you should watch if you’re interested in getting involved:

- [Design](https://github.com/primer/design)
- [Primer CSS](https://github.com/primer/css)
- [Primer React](https://github.com/primer/components)
- [Octicons](https://github.com/primer/octicons)
- [Doctocat](https://github.com/primer/doctocat)
- [Design systems](https://github.com/github/design-systems) (internal to GitHub users)

The Design Systems Team holds office hours twice a week and anyone at GitHub is free to join, ask questions and participate in ongoing conversations. The office hours video links are posted in the #design-systems Slack channel right before the meeting starts.

## Submit an issue 

If you spot something that doesn’t look right in our design, code or documentation, submit an issue to the relevant repo:

- [Interface guidelines](https://github.com/primer/design) 
- [Primer CSS](https://github.com/primer/css)
- [Primer React](https://github.com/primer/components)
- [Octicons](https://github.com/primer/octicons)
- [Doctocat](https://github.com/primer/doctocat)
- [Presentations](https://github.com/primer/presentations)
- [Primer site](https://github.com/primer/primer.style)

If you are unsure where to submit the issue, and you are an internal GitHub user, add it to [design systems](https://github.com/github/design-systems) and the design systems team will triage it accordingly.

**Please remember!** Before submitting an issue, do a quick search to check the same issue hasn’t been submitted yet. If it has, you can participate by commenting with your own examples and ideas.


## Improve the documentation

Documentation is a core part of Primer, and, just as design and code, we’re always trying to make it better and more useful. If you notice something missing, a typo, or have an idea of how the docs can be improved, check if the issue already exists, and, if not, you can do one of the following:

- Submit an issue in the relevant repo
- Submit a pull request with a fix (you can do this directly via the “Edit this page on GitHub” link on the footer of docs pages)

## Close issues

There are issues marked with the label “status: help wanted” across the different Primer repos that we’d love some help with. If you think you can help, add a comment on the issue stating when and (if you know) how you’ll be able to tackle it and we’ll support you throughout. 

### Opening a pull request

When working on an issue, don't worry too much about commit frequency or having the perfect commit message. We squash commits down into a single commit when merging pull requests.

Instead, we encourage you to be detailed in your pull request descriptions. Be sure to address what change is being made, why the change is being made, and add links to the relevant issue or any references used.

## Propose a new component or UI pattern

If you'd like to propose a new Primer component, let's talk! The best way to get started is to message the design systems team in Slack so we can verify if the request (or similar) is already being worked on. If you prefer, you can submit an issue in the [design-systems repo](https://github.com/github/design-systems) (internal GitHub users only) with as much detail about the proposal as possible: problem statement, user and product needs, context, timelines, and anything else that will help triage the issue.

_Please note: Currently we can only accept and work on internal GitHub requests for components._

## Questions and support

If you’re GitHub staff, the quickest way to get help is to ask your question in the #design-systems Slack channel. Otherwise, you can send us a message on Twitter [@githubprimer](https://twitter.com/githubprimer).
