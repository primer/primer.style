    questionTwo: `I'll start with a lesson from a book. [Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/) helped me stop looking for shortcuts. [Javier Cañada](http://www.terremoto.net/) pushed me to think about design outside technology and be inspired by history, literature, philosophy... [Sasha Prokhorova](https://blog.algolia.com/faces-algolia-meet-sasha-prokhorova/) taught me that design is not just about craft. She made me a better professional along with some others who I consider my mentors like [David la Iglesia](https://dribbble.com/de_la_Iglesia), [Adrian Mato](https://adrianmato.com/) or [Emily Hayman](http://emilyhayman.com/). From [Yaili](https://yaili.com/) I learned to love design systems documentation and how to show others the value of it. Then [Nathan Curtis](https://medium.com/@nathanacurtis) content became the manual on how to write and present documentation. [Yesenia](https://www.yeseniaperezcruz.com/) helped me see how design systems can be functional, effective and still convey a brand's personality. The most important lesson, be it design or human level is that communities help us grow and learn from one another. This is why I'm so inspired by people like [Jina](https://www.sushiandrobots.com/), [Mina](http://mina.codes/), [Diana](https://broccolini.net/) or [Stu](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/) who are passionate thought leaders doing so much for the design and development industry.

We needed consistency, stability, a bridge between designers and developers, and a more efficient workflow. Once we put a design language and system in place, I was sold on the value.

This talk by [Bret Victor](https://vimeo.com/36579366) helped me feel less alone when I was starting out in the industry; at a time when code and design weren't yet openly intertwined. I’m also inspired by the folks behind [designbetter.co](https://www.designbetter.co/design-systems-handbook) for making knowledge around design systems transparent and available to everyone.
