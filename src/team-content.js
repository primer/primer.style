    questionOne: `I love organization and lists. I have a lists for things from movies to boba tea orders. I like to bring this into my design work as well, creating components and cohesiveness across platforms to make it easier for people to create great products.`,
    questionTwo: `When I first began learning about design, I was inspired by the people who contributed back to the community by teaching and opening up to students. Resources like [Students Who Design](https://studentswho.design/) and [Design Details](https://designdetails.fm) helped me figure out how I wanted to make a positive impact in tech.

  More recently, I've been inspired by design agencies and companies that are testing the boundaries of design outside of what is accepted as 'common pratice'. I enjoy seeing unique animation and motion used to convey information, emotion, and storytelling.`,

    questionOne: `Ok, this might sound weird, but I really enjoy looking at UIs. There is something satisfying, seeing a bunch of components getting thrown on a page that fit well together, forming a balanced interface for users to interact with. I also enjoy building UIs and helping others to do the same.`,
    questionTwo: `Thinking back, seeing the CSS Zen Garden was really inspiring. Also the CSS "demo scene" found in places like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) is nuts. Admittedly, not always practical, but fun to check out.

  I also got inspired and learned a lot from methodologies like OOCSS, SMACSS, BEM, SUIT and nowadays CSS-in-JS. The "how to organize CSS" is a challenging, but also interesting problem to solve.`,

    questionOne: `I first found out about design systems through my last internship, which was focused on building up a design system for the New York Times. I kept learning more and more about this emerging field, and really started to grow an affinity for it.

  Design Systems seemed to blend all aspects of my interests: Product Design, Front-End Development, Graphic Design, Typography, Illustration, etc. I’m drawn to design systems as it’s a field that welcomes individuals who have too many interests to count, and find themselves at intersections of many different passions. `,
    questionTwo: `I draw in a lot of inspiration from so many different facets of my life. I’m really fortunate to come from a diverse set of backgrounds to be able to see parallels that emerge from a variety of industries.

  The field of Graphic Design has a tremendous influence on me, and some of the designers and studios I’m inspired by are: [Natasha Jen](https://www.pentagram.com/about/natasha-jen), [Barron Webster](https://barronwebster.com/), [Maxime Buschi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diBifN7qBgw), [Michael Bierut](https://www.pentagram.com/about/michael-bierut), [Eric Hu](http://erichu.info/), [Micah Barrett](http://micahbarrett.design/), [Draw Down Books](https://draw-down.com/), [Wei Huang](https://twitter.com/w__h_?lang=en), [Josh Schaub](http://joshschaub.ch/), [Morcoskey](https://morcoskey.com/), and [David Rudnik](https://davidrudnick.org/). I’ve always been inspired by those who are experimenting at the intersection of design and technology: [Tristan Harris](http://www.tristanharris.com/), [Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/), [Studio No-Plans](https://no-plans.com/), [Marie Otsuka](http://motsuka.com/), [Ben Wilkins](https://twitter.com/thatbenlifetho?lang=en), [Jon Gold](https://jon.gold/), [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/),  and [Chris Novello](http://chrisnovello.com/). I also love typography, and have a lot of admiration for type-designers and foundries: [Colophon Foundry](https://www.colophon-foundry.org/), [Kris Sowersby (Klim Type)](https://klim.co.nz/), [Matthew Carter](https://www.myfonts.com/person/Matthew_Carter/), [Richard Lipton](https://lipton.typenetwork.com/), [Lucas Sharp](http://lucassharp.com/), [Grilli Type](https://www.grillitype.com/), and [James Edmondson (OHnotypeco)](https://ohnotype.co/). There’s so many more people that I’ve learned and drawn inspiration from to mention and praise, so feel free to reach out! I’d love to share and discuss. <3`,

    questionOne: `I came into design systems very organically. When I began my career in the agency world, I worked within constraints of branding and style guidelines of our various clients. At the time I didn't fully recognize these guidelines as what we now refer to as design systems. As my career continued to grow I noticed that I began to be far more interested in how various companies/brands packaged the many pieces that made up their brand and/or products. I love how design systems bring together all the pieces in order to unleash endless creativity but still maintain the necessary constraints.`,
    questionTwo: `I get a lot of my inspiration from the community I've built via Dribbble. A few of my favorites are the dynamic duo that makes of [TheLittleLabs](https://www.thelittlelabs.com/), Camilo and Aradhana, the illustration work by [Enisaurus](https://www.enisaurus.com/), and [Kendrick Kidd](http://www.kendrickkidd.com/).

  When I first started my career, [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/) was a huge inspiration. His book, [The Shape of Design](https://frankchimero.com/design/the-shape-of-design/), really helped to form my philosophy and approach to problems and how to cultivate a design process. Along with that but not design related, [Jason Fried](https://twitter.com/jasonfried) has been a great inspiration to how I approach work. His book (written alongside David Heinemeier Hansson) [Rework](https://basecamp.com/books/rework) still is the best, no nonsense, business book I've ever read.`,

    questionOne: `I was initially drawn to design systems while working on a small team, where we were stretched thin and struggling to keep the front-end and user experience afloat, recreating components and patterns by hand over and over again. We needed consistency, stability, a bridge between designers and developers, and a more efficient workflow. Once we put a design language and system in place, I was sold on the value. I find it fascinating how many approaches to design systems there are out there, and how different they can be depending on the individual product and teams’ needs.`,
    questionTwo: `[Inge Druckrey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldSkPqZKBl0) and [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_ei) inspired me to get into design, and introduced me to the world of typographic and informational systems (simultaneously). This talk by [Bret Victor](https://vimeo.com/36579366) helped me feel less alone when I was starting out in the industry; at a time when code and design weren't yet openly intertwined. I’m also inspired by the folks behind [designbetter.co](https://www.designbetter.co/design-systems-handbook) for making knowledge around design systems transparent and available to everyone.  Additionally, and there are too many people to name, people like [Una Kravetz](https://twitter.com/Una?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo), [Tim Holman](https://twitter.com/twholman), and [Val Head](https://twitter.com/vlh) are always on my radar, keeping the internet weird and creative and continuously pushing the boundaries of what's possible.`,

Design Systems feels like the perfect hybrid between the two! \n \n I'm also really into accessibility, and I found that having a design system that enforces accessible standards is one of the easiest ways to make progress on getting a team on-boarded with accessibility best practices and getting those practices implemented in production \n \n I'm super excited about our React component library that we've been working on over the past few months!`,

[Jina](https://twitter.com/jina) is one of the hardest-working people in design systems, and her leadership in the community is a tremendous inspiration. I learned everything I know about SVG from [Sara Soueidan](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan), and everything I could _hope_ to know about CSS Grid from [Rachel Andrew](https://twitter.com/rachelandrew) and [Jen Simmons](https://twitter.com/jensimmons).
